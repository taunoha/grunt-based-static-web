It uses SASS and Mustache template engine. 

It also includes:
* grunt-contrib-jshint

* grunt-prettify
* grunt-contrib-connect

## In the box
* Bootstrap
* Modernizr (customized)
* Owl Carousel

## Setup
*This software requires Grunt `0.4.2`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may start using this software with this command:

```shell
npm install
```
```shell
bower update
```
```shell
grunt build
```
When you start developing, use this command:
```shell
grunt html
```
**It will**:
start the server; open the website in your default browser; look for changed files (*.scss, *.js, *.mustatic); reload your default browser automatically when all tasks have been completed
