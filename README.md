## Setup
*This plugin requires Grunt `0.4.2`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may start using this software with this command:

```shell
npm install
```
```shell
bower update
```
```shell
grunt build
```
If you start developing, use this command:
```shell
grunt html
```
It will look for changed files and create CSS, JS and HTML-s automatically.
